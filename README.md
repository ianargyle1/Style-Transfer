# Style Transfer

This notebook impliments the Style Transfer project for Deep Learning (CS 6955) at the University of Utah. It uses the style transfer technique presented in ["Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks" (Gatys et al., CVPR 2015)](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).

Style transfer is a technique designed to transfer the "style" from a source image onto a target image. In other words recreating one image in the style of another. More details and examples can be found in the notebook.

NOTE: Only the code inbetween the "TODO" comments is written by me.
